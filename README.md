## Advanced `curl` Techniques Guide [Curl](<curl.md>)

This document likely provides a deep dive into the `curl` command, a powerful and versatile tool used for transferring data from or to a server. The guide might cover advanced techniques and use cases, including but not limited to:

- Making complex HTTP requests to APIs or web services.
- Handling authentication and headers in requests.
- Automating and scripting with `curl` in various shell environments.
- Optimizing `curl` commands for specific tasks, such as downloading files, uploading content, or handling redirects and cookies.

### Networking Tcp [Networking TCP](<networking_tcp.md>)

This tutorial presumably focuses on TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), a foundational protocol in the suite of Internet protocols that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. Key areas of exploration might include:

- Understanding the TCP three-way handshake process (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) for establishing a connection.
- Deep dive into TCP header structure, windowing, and flow control mechanisms.
- Practical examples of setting up and troubleshooting TCP connections, including using tools like `netstat`, `tcpdump`, and `wireshark`.
- Discussing TCP's role in modern networking, including its use in HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, and other protocols.

## Curl Network Request [curl Network](<Curl _Network.md>)

This documentation provides an insightful example of a network request made using Curl to access a webpage on GitHub. It captures the entire process from establishing a TCP connection, performing a TLS handshake, sending an HTTP GET request, to finally receiving the server's response.

The example highlights several key points:

- The initial connection attempt to GitHub's server.
- The SSL/TLS handshake process, indicating the negotiation of cryptographic algorithms and secure connection establishment.
- Details of the HTTP GET request made to GitHub, including request headers.
- The server's response, showcasing various HTTP headers returned by GitHub and the HTML content of the response.
- Encryption details and renegotiations during the data transfer phase.

This example is useful for understanding the complexities involved in secure network communications and the detailed exchange between a client and server during a web page request.
